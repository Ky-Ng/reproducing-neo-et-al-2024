# Tutorials

The tutorial folders allow for minimal reproductions/environments to use a specific interpretability technique. 

The main idea is to gain intuition on how the techniques (e.g. forward hooks) work before applying to a more complex problem such as reproducing `Section 4.2 High Activating Prompts`.
